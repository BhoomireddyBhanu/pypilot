        <h3>Exercise 1: Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers</h3>
        <p>
          Given two integer numbers, return their product only if the product
          is equal to or lower than 1000. Otherwise, return their sum.
        </p>
        <p>Given 1:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            {`number1 = 20
number2 = 30
Expected Output:
The result is 600`}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Given 2:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            {`number1 = 40
number2 = 30
Expected Output:
The result is 70`}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h3>Exercise 2: Print the sum of the current number and the previous number</h3>
        <p>
          Write a program to iterate the first 10 numbers, and in each
          iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.
        </p>
        <p>Expected Output:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            {`Printing current and previous number sum in a range(10)
Current Number 0 Previous Number  0  Sum:  0
Current Number 1 Previous Number  0  Sum:  1
Current Number 2 Previous Number  1  Sum:  3
Current Number 3 Previous Number  2  Sum:  5
Current Number 4 Previous Number  3  Sum:  7
Current Number 5 Previous Number  4  Sum:  9
Current Number 6 Previous Number  5  Sum:  11
Current Number 7 Previous Number  6  Sum:  13
Current Number 8 Previous Number  7  Sum:  15
Current Number 9 Previous Number  8  Sum:  17`}
          </code>
